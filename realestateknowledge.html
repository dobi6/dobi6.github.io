        <h1>Here are some tips to be successful in real estate:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Have a job with regular income for 24 months</li>
            <li>Look at different types of loans; such as, FHA loan, VA loan, Conventional loan, Confortable loan, Refinance loan, ect...</li>
            <li>Pick the loan that best suits your financial needs. (Remeber, a fixed rate mortgage loan of 15-30 years is going to have smaller monthly payemt with a higher interest but a short-term mortgage is going to have high monthly payments but a low interest payment.</li>
            <li>Apply for loan that you need, and explain exactly how the property will become successful in the long-term. (You can also tell by the GRM, ROI, NOI and Cap Rate to see wha the properties value will be in the future.</li>
            <li>Do tons of research and tour the property before you purchase it.</li>
            <li>Make sure there's no proeprty damage to the house before you buy it, if there is consult with the agent or broker.</li>
            <li>When selling a property, make sure that you get at least a 10% ROI.</li>
